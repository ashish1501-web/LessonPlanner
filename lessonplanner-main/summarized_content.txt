 It seems that you are trying to explain how to implement a singleton class in C++ with and without using a getInstance() method. Here's a brief explanation of each case:

Case 1: When the instance is created using the getInstance() method to create the Singleton Class.
In this approach, we make all constructors private, delete the copy constructor, create a static member instancePtr, and initialize it with an instance using the new keyword. We then create a getInstance() method that checks if there's already an instance of the class and returns it if it exists or creates a new one if it doesn't. This ensures that only one instance of the Singleton class can be created.

Case 2: When the instance is created without using the getInstance() method to create the Singleton Class.
In this approach, we also make all constructors private and delete the copy constructor. However, instead of creating a getInstance() method, we initialize the static member instancePtr with NULL. This means that when trying to instantiate the Singleton class using the constructor, an error will be thrown as the default constructor is private. Therefore, the only way to access the Singleton instance is by calling the getInstance() method (which doesn't exist in this approach). This results in a compilation error as there is no way to create an instance of the Singleton class.

Overall, the first approach ensures that only one instance of the Singleton class can be created and accessed through the getInstance() method. The second approach fails to compile as there's no way to create or access the Singleton instance.
